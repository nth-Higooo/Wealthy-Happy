# Project: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Happiness (GNH) Analysis

## Introduction

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore and illustrate the intricate relationship between a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its Gross National Happiness (GNH). To accomplish this, the project aims to answer the following key questions:

1. **Is there a correlation between a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its Gross National Happiness (GNH)?**
   - To what extent are these two variables related?
   - Are there exceptions where nations with higher GDPs are not consistently happier?

2. **What are the key factors influencing the relationship between GDP and GNH?**
   - Are specific socioeconomic, cultural, or environmental factors responsible for variations in the relationship?
   - How do policies, social programs, and governance impact this relationship?

3. **Can GDP be considered a reliable predictor of GNH, and vice versa?**
   - To what degree can GDP serve as an indicator of a nation's overall happiness and well-being?

4. **Can GNH be used as a predictive measure for economic success and growth?**
   - What insights can data science techniques and visualization tools provide regarding the GDP-GNH relationship?
   - How can data science methodologies enhance our understanding of this complex relationship?
   - How can data visualization effectively communicate these insights to various stakeholders?

Our primary focus will be on developing website functionality to present the data to the audience, emphasizing that there is a connection between GDP and GNH. We will provide detailed answers from each perspective to ensure an objective and data-driven analysis.
